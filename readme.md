"What if everyone in the game had text constantly around them expressing their feelings? Now, imagine in this game you can CLIMB text?" -- Peter Molydeux

Controls:
---------

* Space = jump
* Left/Rght = move
* Up = grapple

Instructions:
-------------

Grapple onto words and collect words with the goal letter before the time runs out! But watch out, the words disappear when you hop off of them.

* Windows (easy) - VS2010, OpenAL 32-bit, libsndfile 32-bit installer (put dlls in system32)
* Other platforms, Windows (hard) - Needs SFML and a bunch of crap and cmake.
